    <h2>Life</h2>
    <p>In our books, we studied that life is based on oxygen and water, meaning that life needs these two elements to exist. But what if I told you that this only applies to carbon-based life? Other planets may have different elements or even the same elements as Earth, but the building block of life there may not be carbon. Life could be carbon-based, or it might not be. I believe that life depends on the environment, regardless of how hot or cold it is, or how extreme the pressure and radiation may be.</p>

    <h3>Carbon-Based Life</h3>
    <p>Carbon-based life, also known as organic life, exists because carbon has the unique ability to form long organic covalent bonds and complex molecular chains, such as proteins. However, this form of life requires specific temperature and pressure conditions to sustain itself.</p>
    <figure class="image-container">
    <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/53/19/26/531926de41778674c9a5c07efc9239fa.jpg" alt="Chapter Image">
    <figcaption>Carbon Based life</figcaption></figure>
 <z>•	ORGANIC MOLECULES</z>
<p>Carbon-based life made of Organic molecules are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids (such as DNA and RNA). </p>
<z>•	WATER AS A SOLVENT</z>
<p>Water is universal solvent and makes building blocks of our body. </p>
<z>•	ENERGY SOURCES</z>
<p>Carbon-based life primary source is sunlight (photosynthesis) or decomposition of organic matter.</p>
<h2>Silicon based life</h2>
<p>Silicon like carbon it also makes  4 bonds. But silicon compounds are not much stronger than carbon.</p>
    <figure class="image-container">
    <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/d5/55/40/d55540d0fb27acada0b32f7ea9471fd7.jpg" alt="Chapter Image">
    <figcaption>Silicon Based life</figcaption></figure>
<z>WATER</z>
<p>Silicon-based compounds are less soluble in water than carbon based compounds. Means that silicon based life doesn’t depends on water to live. It can soluble in non polar or something else.</p>
<z>TEMPERATURE EXTREMES</z>
<p>Silicon-based compounds can bear more temperature than carbon, means that they can live on high temperature planets like Venus and can also survive in volcanos.</p>
<z>LACK OF PREVALENT SILICON BIOMOLECULES
I</z>
<p>In carbon it form long chains and make protein and DNA like long molecules but Silicon can’t make long chains also can’t make DNA molecules or its silicon alternate. Here on Earth it says that DNA is basic code of life. But during programming in computer there’s not only one language there are many languages like, C++, Java, Python, etc. Similarly here in life there shouldn’t only DNA as code of life. Because Jins are made with fire and angles are made with light. </p>
<z>LACK OF EVIDENCE</z>
<p>There is no evidence to suggest the existence of silicon-based life in the universe.</p>

<h2>BORON-BASED LIFE</h2>
<p>Boron compounds are seems to be stable like organic carbon compounds. But this thing is theoretical. If this type of life exist then its like animals have roots like plants.</p>

    <figure class="image-container">
    <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/e8/79/c0/e879c0539c55899132c6a8cc77379d6a.jpg" alt="Chapter Image">
    <figcaption>Boron Based life</figcaption></figure>
<h2>SULPHUR-BASED LIFE</h2>
<p>Sulphur-based compounds are unstable and can’t make long chains. So they can’t make life. </p>

<h2>PHOSPHORUS-BASED LIFE</h2>
<p>Phosphorus plays an important role in making DNA and RNA molecules. But it can’t take place the carbon because Carbon have 4 bonds and it have 3 bonds. But if it can make DNA and RNA then it can make life that is looks similar to carbon compounds life. In this life I think 〖(CO〗_2) is replaced with 〖(P〗_2 O_5). Also from the figure given below you see human like face but alien or ghost. This is life made by Phosphorus.</p>

            <h2 id="mars">Mars: Possibility of Life & Human Habitation</h2>
            <p>NASA has sent many missions to Mars, but only a few have successfully reached and studied the planet.</p>
            <p>The rovers sent to Mars have cameras and sensors to explore the surface, butno signs of life have been found yet.</p>
            <p>Life on Mars might be possible if humans can adapt to its environment, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wind speed</li>
                <li>Gravity pull</li>
                <li>Magnetic field</li>
                <li>Surface hardness</li>
                <li>Water and mineral availability</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Water on Mars is frozen, and it is unknown if any microorganisms or unknown creatures exist in it.
            If microscopic life exists, it could be harmful to humans, similar to Earth’s germs and viruses.
            Proper training, biological research, and robots to detect viruses and germs are needed before human colonization.
            Scientists may developnew vaccines by studying Martian microorganisms to protect astronauts.
            Robots should be used to grow plants and trigger global warming to melt ice, making Mars more habitable.</p>

            <p>Venus has extreme conditions, making it much less habitable than MarsSome theories suggest Venus was Earth-like in the past, but extreme global warming changed everything. The planet experiences sulfuric acid rain, making human survival impossible with current technology. If life existed on Venus in the past, there should be fossils of ancient organisms. Robots could be sent to search for fossils and study Venus's history. Venus could still have unknown creatures that have adapted to its extreme environment. Due to its conditions, Venus is considered a “life-dead planet” today.</p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title">Mercury</h2>
        <p class="chapter-content">
            Mercury is the planet that is totally near to the Sun and absorbs its energy. This planet is made from silicates, which are used to make solar panels. 
            <x>Atmosphere</x>
            <p>Mercury have no atmosphere no pressure means effects of heat is only on surface not in envirnoment</p>
            <x>Tidally locked</x>
            <p>Mercury is tidally locked so that no days and night forms</p>
            <x>Temperature</x>
            <p> we only think its hot planet and all where hot around it. But we are wrong. One side of Mercury that's day side a few km away from Sun surface is extremly hot. While the night side even a few Km away from Sun's surface is extreamly cold. Due to reason silicates in surface and no atmosphere to trap heat from Sun.</p>
            <x>Dyson Sphere</x>
            We can destroy half of Mercury to get enough solar energy to create a strong magnetic field for the formation of wormholes, and we can extract a star’s energy using a Dyson Sphere. 
            <x>Envirnoment</x>
            This planet is dry, and its magnetic field is too weak to stop solar winds that contain charged particles. Also, the metal here is in molten form.
        </p>

        <p>
            But I think ghosts (jinn) can live on Venus and Mercury. Just like humans are made from clay and live on Earth, which mostly contains clay, and our bodies are composed of 70% water, jinn are made from fire and might be able to survive there. In the Holy Quran, it is explained that jinn are made from fire.
        </p>
        <p class="chapter-content">
            <b>Surah 15, Verse 27</b><br>
            <z>"And the jinn We created before, of intensely hot fire."</z>
        </p>

            I think most jinn lived here, no one knows.

        <h2 class="chapter-title">Ice and gas giants</h2>
        
        <p>
           <x>Wind:</x> 
            Ice giants have wind speed too much that we can’t live here. But some life can be possible there. Because we haven’t seen what inside the Jupiter.
            <x>Things that can survive</x>
            We only see the surface that is only storm we haven’t see what inside it. Also on our earth fishes can survive in high speed water and eagles can fly in high speed wind. So on Jupiter and its like planets that have wind speed faster.
            <x>Survival in Magnetic field</x>
            We have animals like bodies like that fishes and eagles like wings and also Jupiter like planets have strongest magnetic field means the species on Jupiter can also have quality like Salmon, cat fish and sea turtle that can bear high fields. 
            <x>Moons</x>
            The moon of Jupiter (Titan-Moon) have some earth like qualities but its too much cold to live. I think in the figure below you see ice monster like species can live on Titan.
            
            <x>Condition to survive there:</x>
            These planets have large wind speeds and also his body explain streamline that can pass the air without problem. Also it have eyes that can act like glasses like in our eagles, Their foot shot be long that help them to touch more surface of solid core that helps them to make grip in strong air speed. Also have big bodies that can overcome the effect of gravity on them. Also their bodies are like Turtle.  Turtle like bodies help them to face strong magnetic field of planet. Animals like musk Ox and polar bear have hairs to survive in cold environment. But the planets below absolute zero have frozen life.
            <x>Surface Problem</x>
        We see no solid surface but it might be solid surface inside it or we can apply these properties on (Titan, Eourpa-Moon). Some germs are frozen in Antarctica in ice. The specie should be like it. The main problem is heat, life needs heat and solar energy is too much week here so it might not be carbon based life here.
        Also Eourpa have ocean inside they layer of surface. In (2019) a staellite saw the spring of water from Eourpa surface.
        <x>Overall (Jupiter, Saturun, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto)</x>
        Overall, Specie should have streamline shape (face strong winds), high surface aera of foots (making grip in wind), Reptile and rock like skin (protect them from strong magnetic field and also help to face gravity that can make heart fail), Have hairs (To face low temperatures), Have eagle like eyes (To see in high speed wind).
Jupiter’s moon Titan can be possible as to hold life because of solid surface and have mountains and have frozen fluids.

        <h1>Exo Planets</h1>
        
        
        <h2>1. NEPTUNE-LIKE EXOPLANET:
</h2>
 <p>They are often located far from their host stars. For these planets which have temperature lower. But if they have ice in their composition then they can survive in such planets also they don’t need much more solar energy like spiders they can spend their whole life in caves without sunlight absorption and also without food spiders can live for many years. Maybe some spider like creatures can live in much lower temperature can live there. </p>

    <figcaption>Spider like organism that have ice in blood and live on Neptune like planets</figcaption></figure>
        <h2>2. HOT SUPER-EARTHS</h2>
        <p>Very large and having rocky surface and high temperature too much near to host stars, humans can’t live on hot super Earths but the spices like I have explained in Mercury topic of this chapter can live here. 

</p>
<h2>3. SUPER-EARTHS</h2>
<p>These are larger than Earth and have ice in composition. These suppose to be Neptune like but this is wrong. Neptune size is grater in super earths are grater then earth but smaller than ice giants, Super Earth have solid surface but Neptune like don’t have solid surface. So they don’t consider as Neptune. On Super Earth frozen life is here. Germs that are present in Antarctica in ice and some spider like species that I explained in Neptune like Planets of this chapter can live here. </p>
<h2>4. EXOMOONS</h2>
<p>ExoMoons haven’t discovered yet till 2025, So we can’t say anything without watching their environment and composition.</p>
<h2>5. EARTH 2.0</h2>
<p>Earth 2.0 have star that is G type and have temperature nearly equal to Sun. Earth 2.0 have temperature and orbital period nearly equal to Earth. These have oxygen, Nitrogen, carbon dioxide and many gases in atmosphere and have liquid water and have wind speed equal to earth and having liquid rotating core and its rotation is equal to Earth’s core rotation. Also have some planets that pull the comets towards them like Jupiter. </p>

<p>But unfortunately there’s only one planet found in universe from evolution of astronomy to now 2024. That’s our Earth. Mars is also like Earth but it needs some changing in it, like it needs Global Warming and plants. Then it will be like us. Gliese 581 G and many more don’t have such qualities but are in Golidlocks zone. 
While Kepler-452b is same as Earth in temperature, distance from star and orbital period and temperature of Star, but defects are also explained in this chapter in Kepler 452b topic.

<div class="container">
    <h2>Rouge planets</h2>
    <p>
        <x>Size and magnetic field</x>
        No host star, having size too much even 47 times grater than Jupiter. Frozen and blind and dark planets. Rocky surface and lonines with no sounds and no magnetic field.
        <x>Zero Posiblities of llife:</x>
The spiders that I have explained in Neptune-like can exist on them. But one thing that I want to explain is there’s no plants here means no primary consumer so then no secondary consumer exist. Because a star is basic source of energy for a planet life, no matter its hot or cold, it provide photons and other energy radiations but rouge planets due lack of Star they don’t have life. Not any type of life can’t be possible there. 
<x>Life can possible:</x>
Life here can be possible if there's any volcanic activity causing some release of radiations or abosorbing any other raditaions can produce plants here.
            <figure class="image-container">

    <figcaption>Plants on Rouge planets</figcaption></figure>
</p>
<x>Another way of life:</x>
<p>
But if black hole attract it and make it a blanet but not too much near. Or this planet due to its large size it attract a white dwarf star and make it to revolve around it then life can be possible there but it can make only one side of planet as warm during day but life end at night. But if this white dwarf make it too much warm that at night its temperature maintain and plants can get enough energy during day time. Then life can be possible. But if that condition is possible.
Also I have an idea about them that plants on Earth consume Photons or visible energy. In these planets there must be some organisms on these planets that consume cosmic rays or dark energy. Or maybe some organisms that eat surface of planet.

<h1>Gliese-581-G</h1>
        <p><z>Introduction</z>
        Discovered in 2010, also called Zarmina world or Gliza. It was the 1st planet where water was in liquid form and the distance from host star is in Goldilocks zone. This planet also have land and clouds. This planet says that it needs life. Here the comets also fall on it or sometimes comets fall on other planets in this staller system.
        <z>Animal and Bird:</z>
        The host star is red dwarf means that the animals and birds live on it have potential to live in cold environment, they must have fat skin with long hairs. The size of planet is  times of Earth means it have stronger gravity, the species live in it should have strong body that can’t fail their heart and their density is too much grater that the gravity of planet shouldn’t pull them and they stuck with surface of planet, their size also much more grater.

    <figcaption>Birds on Gliese 581-G</figcaption></figure>
      </p>
        <p><z>Plants:</z>
The plants there must maybe green or may not be green. Because there’s too much low photons to do photosynthesis, but here red or blue color maybe exist that can absorb IR or UV. They are primary source of energy. So they should be necessary for life.

    </p>
    <p>
    <z>Fishes:</z>
    Water here is in liquid form and there must be some aquatic fishes live in this planet. But we discovered our Earth’s ocean 5% then how we can look at this? This is still mystery. Maybe only microbes live there or maybe some big monsters live there that we see in fairy tales stories. Watching planet size I think there should more big sharks live there size more grater than McLendon (sharks).

      <p>
          <z>Why live is not possible here?</z>
 <v>1. Star:</v><p>
 It is orbiting around the red dwarf dying star. Means this star can only live for few years now. And it will be destroyed and its gravity vanished and its planets become rouge planets or they strike with each other and broken or they orbit around each other or they pull dead star. Everything makes them not possible for life. Or we watch its past but maybe vanished in present.
 <v>2. core:</v><p>
 No verification of core means that if core is not rotating it will not produce magnetic field and cosmic rays from star will make aliens died. If such core exist then Ok, if not then no life.
 </p>
     <v>3. Oxygen:</v><p>
No oxygen or some other fluids like water can make a alien died, if aliens doesn’t need such life then it will be fine.
 </p>   
      <v>4. Age:</v><p>
No oxygen or some other fluids like water can make a alien died, if aliens doesn’t need such life then it will be fine.
 </p>   
 <v>5. Comets:</v><p>
Comets rain on planet. If other planets pull comets then its ok for life. But if even a small comet fall here. Life ends like a small comet ends the dinosaurs on Earth. </p>
         <v>6. Tidally locked:</v><p>
Tidally locked, means one side extreme hot while other extreme cold. Life is only possible between day and night. </p>

<h1>Mars</h1>
<p>red planet actually its atmosphere make it red. Mars is planet which have temperature less than Russia or Norway or Green Land (-10℃). In Mars there’s water present but in frozen form.</p>
<v>Animals + Birds + Planets + Fishes:</v>
<p>NASA send a robot (Mars Rover) on Mars and they don’t see anything like that on Mars, means that there’s no life on Mars.</p>
<b>Why There’s No life?</b>
<v>Lack of Oxygen:</v>
        <P>In its composition of atmosphere the Argon is main component, then comes Nitrogen, then Oxygen and then Carbon dioxide and water vapours. For humans there’s need of Oxygen and Nitrogen. Nitrogen here is in great amount but Oxygen is in very less amount means that we can’t live here.</P>
        <v>Very Low Pressure:</v>
        <p>Also the pressure on Mars is much more, thousands times less than pressure on Earth. Here if we breath in such pressure we can die. Because our lungs need a certain pressure to inhale oxygen when the pressure is low outside and high inside the lungs of human on mars means  we can’t survive. We can only survive in condition when environment pressure is high and lungs is low. Then fluid moves towards low pressure. This is Bernoulli’s law type that where pressure is low speed will be high.
No Trees and Rocky environment:
Rocks are present on Mars, There’s No trees, Just mountains and rocks and clear sky and also when wind comes it destroy rocks too. The cold desert also present on Mars and that is green point for us.
</p>
<B>Can we make it Habitable?</B>
<p>Yes, we can, if we follow some terms.

<v>1st</v> We should send more and more robots on Mars with gas cylinder and plants. Then Robots grow plants there. The cylinders help to melt the ice into water and then make small streams that takes water to the plants. For plants we should cover them with glass and then apply carbon dioxide and open them in Sunlight. Remember chose plants that require low photons for photosynthesis. Then these robots cut the rocks and makes the houses for humans. Then they should try to make glass or something else that can maintain the pressure inside it, I mean totally sealed. Then growing more plants means more oxygen. Then take some animals and enclose them in cover of plants. Then they breath and makes carbon dioxide and then plants consume it and makes Oxygen. Then slowly spread this thing.
<v>2nd</v> Remove covers on one side and let plants and animals to survive on small land. 
<v>3rd</v> take solar panels and fans here that can move air and make pressure.
<v>4th</v> Take technology here and then allow animals to move out on land of mars.
<v>5th</v> Humans should also go on Mars, they should cover them in glass or the homes that made by robots. That radiations on Mars don’t hurt humans.
<v>6th</v> make collines on desert land. 
<v>7th</v> Do global warming here to maintain temperature and make ice into water. Earth needs global cooling and mars need global warming.

        <h1>Kepler 452-b:</h1>
        <p>
            
This planet is totally like Earth. Everything Like Earth. But it can be or can't be like Earth.
Let's discuss about it.

<z>Host Star:</z>
            Host star is a bit larger than our Earth. Like our Sun its also G-Type star. Kepler -452b, have distance from Sun same as Earth from Sun. Means that possible Temperature for Humans
            <z>Size:</z>
            A little bigger than Earth.
            <z>Envirnoment:</z>
            Its Atmosphere is like Earth. Some reports says that this planet have water and land both. And also some scientist belive 1 atm pressure with oxygen in air.
            <z>Animals, Plants and Birds:</z>
       If the core of planet is in liquid form and rotates and makes magnetic field then birds and plants are same as earth like.
       </p>
          <figure class="image-container">

    <figcaption> If Core is Liquid then species looks like Us</figcaption></figure><p>
    But a little difference like no magnetic field produce by core. Means that they have to face the solar flare of host stars. Then they have rock like body. Plants should also have change in them like change color to bright and also absorb the cosmic rays instead of visible rays. Also making the planet same as in end world in Minecraft. And make humans Ender-man if he eats plants. I am explaining these things he’ll not be exactly like Ender-man  or some rokey body like Rino.

    <figcaption> If Core is hard then species looks like rock</figcaption></figure></p><p>
       
       <z>Fishes:</z>
       Same as Earth doesn’t matter about core, because here cat fish can bear strong radiations so in this planet fishes are same.

       <b>Why we say live can’t possible?</b>
       
       
       
       
        </p>
       <p><b>1.</b> core problem but specie can change but doesn’t end due to it. But if human go there he definitely die if core doesn’t produce magnetic field.
       </p><p>
<b>2.</b> There must be advance alien civilization there that have technology but if there exist then we see satellite there. But nothing found there means no life here.</p><p>
<b>3.</b> surface of earth is mostly made of Silicon Dioxide but here mostly surface is rocky means no soil that means no plants means no photosynthesis means no food means no life. But maybe some plants can grow on rocks or we only see rocks in this planet soil maybe also exist.</p><p>
<b>4.</b> main thing, this planet is alone in this solar system. Means no planet like Jupiter to attract comets. If there exist some kepler belt like thing or asteroid field, means all life here destroyed after many years or no life here. Because when a asteroid hit by Earth then for thousands of years it becomes like ball of fire and on kepler-452-b all time rain. So, there’s no life here. But if this field doesn’t exist then life can exist here. Certainly. These comets makes life and they take life from planet by the order of Allah Almighty. </p> 
        
        
        
        <h2>Problems to contact and find Aliens:</h2>
        <p>We are always failed to make connection between us and advance alien civilization.
Why?
</p>
    <p>
        
        The answer my friends is Einstein Time cone as I explained earlier in  topic <b>time and telescope.</b>
    </p>   
    <v>Mars</v>
        <p>SunLight takes 8 min and 17 seconds to reach at Earth. Same light takes 20 minutes from Earth to <b>Mars</b>. Means we can’t do video or voice call from mars to Earth because distance is very high. </p>
  
    <p>
        
         is 4.2 light years away from us and it takes 4.2 years to send signals and if there’s advance alien civilization lived then it takes 4.2 years to get back signal. 
    </p>
    <v>Kepler-452b</v>
    <p>Kepler-452b that is 1810 light years away from our Earth. Means it takes 3620 years to send and receive signals. And if some planets and stars and others absorb this signal then it takes more years. And to go even on Proxima centurai is impossible even 4.2 Light Years difference. But a rocket with 10 Km/sec speed can take millions of years to reach there.</p>
    <v>Dr. Neal Thyson</v>
    <p> Documentaries. One of his video explain the distance. If we take Earth as foot ball of 1 foot diameter. Then size of mount Everest we can’t see by necked eye. But the place where the 1st man dive from space to earth is just one small 8mm nail size from foot ball. The distance between satellite orbit and us is just 1 inch above that we called space. The distance between geo stationary satellite and us is just 2m away a door from foot ball. And Moon just 1km away from football. And mars don’t ask.The distance between moon and Earth is too much high that we can fit all planets of solar system in it. After that its gravity can effect us.</p>
    
    
    <v>Ubaid UR Rehman</v>
    <p>All universe is a click. Every planet is habitable. But it doesn't mean living things live in it. Some active natural activities also live in it. Example Volcanic activies in Rougue planets. As Per <b>Stephen Hawking</b> That we shouldn't contact with Aliens but me says we should. We have need to see the Creation of <b>Allah Almighty</b>. Every Planet says that it have something in it that's benefit for human. Nothing is useles my friends. Nothing is useless. Like we can sacrifice Mercury Planet to make Dyson Sphare. Then it can make too much electricity that we can run <b>Alcubierre drive</b>. Everything is possible if human want. </p>
