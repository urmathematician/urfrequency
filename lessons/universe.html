            <p>Everyone wants to know where we come from, how we exist and where are we going?
I haven’t any answer yet but I can tell you I know better then you but my Allah knows better than you and me also.
The real answer Allah Knows better.
I can only guess.

         <h1>Universe</h1>
         <h2>Religion:</h2>
         <p>All religions and people have different believes on solar system and universe. Hindus believe that Sun and moon are their gods. They think moon is their god and Sun is the ride of their god and one time the monkey face (one of their gods try to eat sun). He move from Earth and try to eat Sun funny. 
While Atheist believe in modern Science research and about Christens I haven’t read bible yet. 
In Islam Allah said that Sun and Moon revolves around their fixed points (two different points means Sun and moon have different orbiting points) Sun rise from East and set at west (means in galaxy if we see sun its movement is from east to west) and Sun rise from Sun can’t caught the moon and Moon can’t catch the Sun (proof that both don’t have same orbits). 
I write what in Quran not write verses word to word.
The Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H) also played with moon in childhood and also broke moon into two pieces and join again. The broken moon can also clearly seen from satellites or telescopes.
After relating universe and Quran Allah wants to ask you something:
</p>
<b>Surah Rehman 55, repeated mostly:</b>
<v>Which, then, of your Lord's blessings do you both deny?
</v>

         <h2>Existence:</h2>
              <p>The Universe is everything from the tiniest particle(Quark) to larger galaxies, how it made? The most widely explanation is the big bang theory and string theory. Hubble’s observations suggested that there was a time, called the big bang, when the universe was infinitesimally small and infinitely dense. Under such conditions all the laws of science, and therefore all ability to predict the future, would break down. In this theory, there was a small ( a few millimeter wide) tiny singularity (black hole) was present. Then it suddenly exploded and the space, matter, energy and time produces. Anyone of you can tell me how that tiny singularity forms? No one can give you correct answer but I can give you a clue according to UR Theory: The vibrations of energy that come from higher speeds and when they brought to lower speed or vibrate to specific frequency then they produce a tinny super massive and super charged particle . Then according to big bang theory, that universe is created from light.
The universe passes through different stages to produce life.

     <h2>History(MUSLIM ASTRONOMERS):</h2>
     
     <p>Muslim astronomers have a great work on  astronomy throughout history. Islamic astronomy developed during the Islamic Golden Age, primarily between the 8th and 13th centuries. But Europe always hide them. </p>
     <ol>
     <v>1.Al-Battani (858-929):</v>
     <p>Also known as Albategnius, Please don’t call him that name he’s Muslim not Christin or Jew , he was an Arab astronomer and mathematician who find the correct circumference of earth. And also make precise calculation for solar year. He was also expert in apply sin, cos and tangent equations on spheres and introduce spherical quadrantes.</p>

<v>2. Al-Farghani (c. 9th century): </v>
     <p>He wrote the "Kitab fi Jawani" (Book on the Elements of Astronomy), which were then used by Europe and steel data and the Kepler like people works according to his book but everything was not mentioned in our books.</p>
    <v>3. Al-Zarqali (1029-1087): </v>
     <p>He was the 1st who relates the time and motion of celestial objects. Its 40% related to Einstein time cone but not totally Einstein time come. Einstein copied his work as he always think about space and time and he go clue and make time cone. Al-Zarqali's also made Ptolemaic model of the solar system. Time when no one believes that Earth revolve around Sun.</p>  
 <v>4. Al-Sufi (903-986):  </v>
     <p>His book "Book of Fixed Stars" that have knowledge of 1000 stars and their properties and descriptions. And the images on sky that made by combination of stars are discovered by him. We’ll deal these images I many topics of this chapter.</p>

     <h2>History(ASTRONOMERS):</h2>
      <v>Nicholas Copernicus:  </v>
     <p>His idea was that the sun was stationary at the center and that the earth and the planets moved in circular orbits around the sun. He goes against the catholic saying that sun revolve around the earth and then they gave him punishment, they burn him.</p>
     <v>Galileo:  </v>
     <p>Famous for making telescope and then he observed sky. When he looked at the planet Jupiter, Galileo found small satellites or moons that orbited around it. This sense make him to think that Copernicus was right that Sun is stationary while other objects revolve around it. However, Copernicus’s theory was much simpler.
The picture of universe is constant because there is a massive and a big black hole that spread to many light years is present in center and all stars and galaxies clouds and all energy is revolving around the black hole.
</p>
          <v>Isac Newton:  </v>
     <p>1st who gave the mathematical form of gravitational force and explain gravity very well that Al-Khazini failed to explain and formulate. (The story that Newton was inspired by an apple hitting his head. All Newton himself ever said was that the idea of gravity came to him as he sat “in a contemplative mood” and “was occasioned by the fall of an apple.”). Newton also gave many laws of planets and stars and gravity related to them in absolute time. He was failed to explain it.</p>
          <v>Albert Einstein:</v>
     <p>A person who’s favorite person was Newton. And Einstein regenerate ideas and make his ideas floap and discover that time is not absolute.  Al-Zarqali already told about it but no one believed him and he himself can’t understand that time isn’t same everywhere. But Einstein explain this very well and also he explain the motions of black holes in his general theory of relativity.</p>

    <h2>Sun</h2>
    <p>The Sun is the star at the center (not center but too much close to center) of our solar system. It is a massive, hot ball of gas primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. The Sun's gravitational pull keeps the planets of the solar system in orbit around it. It is primary source of energy for everything in Solar system.</p>

    <v>Size and Composition:</v>
    <p>The Sun's diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is approximately 330,000 times greater than Earth. It is primarily composed of hydrogen (about 74%) and helium (about 24%).</p>
        <v>Nuclear Fusion:</v>
    <p>The Sun's energy is generated through a process called nuclear fusion, in which two hydrogen atoms combine to make a helium atom with great release of energy.</p>
     <v>Temperature and Layers: </v>
    <p>The Sun's core is extremely hot, with temperatures of 6000℃ at surface and millions of ℃ in core. The outermost layer is the solar atmosphere, which includes the photosphere (visible part of Sun or surface we see by eyes) , chromosphere (a layer of plasma) , and corona (outer most region of sun contain hot gases or plasma. (reference : Sicencedirect.com)</p>
     <v>Solar Wind:</v>
    <p>Sun have tinny holes inside it and cosmic rays come out from it. It happens when sun changes its polarity, north pole become south and south become north. Then cosmic rays comes out and when they hit by earth’s magnetic field they cannel each other and make Northern and Southern Lights (Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis).</p>

<h2>Every Planet Explained</h2>
<v>1. Mercury (☿)</v>
<p>
    <z>Location</z>
    In front of Sun and it is smallest
planet. On it there’s no sign of life.
Also its surface is made by silicates
rocks by which we can extract
silicon and can make Solar panels.
    <z>Atmosphere</z>
Its atmosphere is extremely thin
with heat extraction. If we sacrifice
this planet and makes rings around
the Sun then we can get energy to
make Alcubierre drive (bend space
time and go in another world within
seconds). 
    <z>Round around Sun</z>
Its rotation is too much slow as
compare to earth. One spin of
Mercury is equal to 59 spins of
Earth days. (3:2 ratio) of spinning.But it is fastest in revolving around
the Sun (58.6) days. Means one year
on Mercury is equal to (0.16 Years)
= (1 month and 28.6 days).</p>

    <v>2. Venus ♀</v>
<p>
        <z>Inroduction</z>
    It is hottest planet and reason of its
hotness describe in global warming
or entropy chapter.
    <z>Speed</z>
As compare to
Earth the Venus is very slow 243
times slower than earth. 
    <z>Revolution</z>
If Earth day
revolution is one earth day then one
Venus revolution is 243 days.
Means ( 1 day on Venus = 243 days
of Earth).
<z>Past</z>
The surface of Venus is very hot.
Life was only possible on Venus
before dinosaurs.
    
Because it was in
comfort zone like our zone when
earth was in ice age. Some people
believed that women come from
Venus ♀ that’s why we use woman
symbol like it but it was only a
theory not reality. Just like
Environment, size and one more
thing rotational speed we can say
Venus was twin of Earth.
<z>Research</z>
According
to Modern research Earth core is
also slowing down that makes it
slower in present day Earth one
minute is not 60 seconds its 61
seconds now. 
<z>Atmosphere</z>
The Atmosphere is most dangerous
here. Here we see the rain of
Sulphuric Acid (𝐻2𝑆𝑂4). Its
environment also contain Carbon
DiOxide ( 𝐶𝑂2). That’s due to
global warming. As we know when
Dinosaur end global warming starts
and when Global warming ends Ice
age starts. If Sun size remains same
then I surely say it will show Global
Cooling (Ice age).</p>

        <v>3. Earth 🌎</v>
<p>
    <z>Introduction</z>
    It have moderate temperature for
life and it also have water. Its
environment is suitable for life and
its core is in liquid form whose
moment produce magnetic field that
block bad particles and radiations
from sun.
<z>Atmosphere</z>
Its atmosphere contain
Ozone (𝑂3) that keep us safe from
UV radiation of Sun. Its air contain
mostly Nitrogen (𝑁2 ) that prevent
everything from burring, without it
just a little spark and we burn whole
Earth. Oxygen (𝑂2 ) is life giving
gas here. Water (𝐻2𝑆𝑂4) maintain
temperature and life giving
material. 
<z>Revolution and Time</z>
Earth one day is 24 hours
and 1 year is 356 days that we made
standard unit. 
<z>Temperauture</z>
Its min temperature is (-50
℃). in fridge zone and normal temperatureis (25℃) and maximum temperature due to
global warming is (55℃). Maybe in Solar
Flare 2025 its temperature would reach (60-
65℃).</p>

            <v>4. Mars ♂</v>
<p>
    <z>Introduction</z>
    It can have life because a populated
city on Earth is colder then Mars. It also
have water but it is in form of ice. 
<z>Temperature</z>
The
temperature of Mars is hotter than
Russia and cooler than Europe (-10 C). Mars red surface because of it’s red
shift (moving away from us), it’s color
isn’t red it’s like our Earth without
water and having ice glaciers,
<z>Envirnoment</z>
When it
moves toward us its color become blue.

The mountains are more higher than the
mountains of earth and storms are too
much strong that they can broke
mountains.
<z>Life</z>
There’s no life on mars because its
oxygen level is low and its temperature
and pressure is not maintain for human.
Maybe our heart will rapture because of
its pressure. Some people believe that
man comes from ♂ but it is false.
<z>Period</z>
The day period of mars is 24.6 hours,
that is called mars day or it is also called
sol. mars take one revolution around the
Sun in 2 Earth years. Means one year on
mars is equal to two earth years</p>

               <v>5. Jupiter (♃)</v>
<p>
    <z>Inroduction</z>
    It is biggest and heaviest planet of solar
system(A Failed Star) . It can also attract Sun towards
itself and make Sun to rotate about a
point called Barycenter. But it doesn’t
have solid surface. Jupiter’s surface is
like clouds of gases. It also have a ring
like( ♄ )Saturn but it is invisible. If it is
only composed of gas then it should be
light one than why it is heavy because
of it’s solid core. It is most dense in
whole planets. 
<z>Denstiy and Gravity</z>
The density of Jupiter is
less than water. Jupiter’s gravity also
attract comets that can hit by us, but
Thanks Allah that he made balance in
Solar system. 
<z>Time on Jupiter</z>
The day on Jupiter is about 9 hours and
55 minutes. It means on Earth it has 24
hours which is equal to 2.4 days on
Jupiter. 
<z>Envirnoment and Surface</z>
Jupiter is gas giant Its
composition is mainly from gases.
Jupiter have no solid surface. Its core is
large and solid composed of icy and
slushy materials. Means it doesn’t stop
particles from Sun.
<z>Magnetic Field</z>
But it can create
magnetic field and block bad radiation
from Sun. We only see ring in Saturn
but Every gas or ice giant has its own
ring.
<z>Ring</z>
Jupiter’s ring is too much thin to
see. Jupiter is too much big that it not
only revolve around the Sun even it
disturb the Sun. Means it forces the Sun
to revolve around itself. Means it is too
much strong that it disturb the motion of
Sun that it move around itself. This
point is called barycenter.
<z>Failed Star</z>
The Jupiter is also called the failed Star.
If it is big and contain a little more gas
then it glows like a star.</p>

               <v>6. Saturn( ♄)</v>
<p>
    <z>Introduction</z>
    It’s a ring planet you already know
about it.
<z>Atmosphere</z>
The main thing in it contains
liquid gases and always the rain of
liquid gases and sulphuric acid come
there. 
<z>Ring</z>
It’s ring is made by dust like
rocks that’s why it is visible. Like
Jupiter Saturn is also gas giant, mainly
composition is gases. 
<z>Surface and density</z>
It has less solid
surface. Like Jupiter the Saturn also
have too much low density.
<z>Period</z>
The rotational period of Saturn is 10
hours, 33 minutes and 38 seconds and
one day on Earth is equal to 2.4 Saturn
days. Saturn takes 30 Earth years in
revolving around the Sun, means 1 year
on Saturn is equal to 30 years on Earth.
<z>Composition</z>
Like Jupiter Saturn its gas composition
is Hydrogen and Helium. Its core is
large and solid composed of icy and
slushy materials. Means it doesn’t stop
particles from Sun. But it can create
magnetic field and block bad radiation
from Sun.</p>

    Uranus is the 1st ice giant. Uranus is
famous for it’s blue color and it is an ice
giant and here we can see it’s surface
contain diamonds. 
<z>90 degree flip</z>
The famous thing in
Uranus is that it can move 90 degree in
one direction .
<z>Compostion</z>
Its air composition is
frozen Hydrogen and Helium. Its core
consist of small, rocky and solid
composed of icy and slushy (crystals)
materials. Means it doesn’t stop
particles from Sun.
<z>Magnetic field</z>
It can create
magnetic field and block bad radiation
from Sun. Like Saturn it also have a
ring. 
<z>Period</z>
Its one day is equal to 17 Hours and 14
minutes. Which means one day of Earth
is equal to One day and 7 hours on Uranus. Its one year is equal to 84 Earth
years.</p>

    It is not a giant planet it is also ice giant.
It’s surface is rough and it’s low
temperature.
<z>Dull light</z>
We can see sun from here it looks like a
moon giving light to us. And everything
frozen here. 
<z>Frozen</z>
Life can’t be possible here because everything Frozen. But if
some creatures that are able to live in
this environment can live here. 
<z>Ring</z>
Like
Saturn it also have ring. 
<z>Composition</z>
Its core is also
like Uranus made from Iron, Nickel and
silicates in frozen and slushy form. It
doesn’t block particles but it block
radiation from Sun due to its magnetic
field. 
<z>Atmosphere</z>
Like other gas giants Neptune’s
atmosphere also composed from
Hydrogen and Helium but one gas more
that is methane.
<z>Period of Day</z>
16 hours and 14
minutes. One day on Earth is equal to
1.5 days on Neptune. Its one year is
equal to 165 Earth years.

<p>
    <z>Introduction</z>
    It was consider as a planet but now it is
consider as a rock or any other object.
<z>Period of year</z>
Because its revolving period is 3650
years means one year on Pluto is equal
to 3650 earth years.
<z>Period of Day</z>
One Pluto day is
equal to 6.4 Earth years.
<z>Atmosphere</z>
Pluto have very thin atmosphere
composed from mainly Nitrogen,
Methane and Carbon Monoxide.
<z>Frozen Surface</z>
Its surface is frozen and everything is
frozen here. 
The mantel of Earth is composed of
magma or lava but the mantel of Pluto
composed of frozen water and other
frozen materials. 
<z>Core</z>
Its core is frozen and composed of
silicates in frozen form. <z>Why we can’t
say it as a planet?.</z> The 1st reason
everyone’s knows that is its size no
bigger than moon, 2nd is it is too much
far, 3rd is a planet never lie in kipper beltor asteroid, there’s an asteroid field
between Mars and Jupiter but there’s no
planet in it. 4th some rocks and objects
are grater in size in kypler belt. Also the
Orbit seems like round of other planets
but the objects like Pluto have more
elliptical orbit than all planets and
Asteroids. Pluto is called a Dwarf
planet.</p>

From here big comets come. When
comets revolve around Sun then they
make its light dim as they act like

    <h2>Barycenter</h2>
    <p>People think that Sun is the center of
Our Solar System. But They’re wrong.
There's is another center.So I already Explain in Jupiter section
that Jupiter also pull the Sun this allows
the Sun to revolve around its own axis.And if we compare the direction Sun
with direction of Earth its movement is
from East to West. This thing we never
seen before but in discovery of
exoplanets we see the movements of
stars that is similar like that. So this
relative motion between stars and
planets is discovered. The 99% mass of
our Solar system is our Sun that’s the
reason it is too much near to barycenter.
Not only the Stars have barycenter
planets also have this center that makes
the motion of our universe very difficult
and hard to understand. The Earth not
also revolving around the Sun even not
spinning around its own axis it also

    <h2>ExoPlanets</h2>
    <p>Planets that orbit another star than Sun are called Exo-Planets. There are many exo-planets discoverd now. But we explained only few.</p>
<b>Planets with zero life Potential</b>
<v>Wasp-68b:</v>
<p>WASP-68b orbits a star known as
WASP-68. This host star is a G-type
star, similar to our Sun. It is 590 light
years away from us. It is also classified
as a hot Jupiter. It has very short period
to revolve around its hot star about 5.1
Earth days. Means 1 year on this planet
is 5.1 earth days. Temperatures
reaching very high levels due to near

    <p>
        These are just theoretical planets maybe
exist or maybe not. Carbon planets are
carbon rich planets. They are different
from other planets, they only have
carbon and carbon compounds like
diamonds and graphite. These planets
are also called (Diamond worlds).

    <v>    Gliese-667Cc:</v>
    <p>Gliese 667Cc orbits the star Gliese 667
C, which is part of a triple star system
(Gliese 667 A, B, and C). Gliese 667 C
is a red dwarf star and too much cooler
than our Sun. Gliese 667Cc revolved
around its host star in 28.5 Earth days.
And also it is in the region where
temperature is suitable for life but it has
no liquid water.
    </p>

    
    <b>Planets with Some Life (In Goldilocks Zone)</b>
    <v>GoldiLocks Zone:</v>
    <p>Before knowing about planets we should know about Goldilocks zone. The aera around the
planet whose temperature is normal for life and this zone might be habitable. This is the
region around a star where conditions may be suitable for liquid water to exist on the
planet's surface.
I have knowledge of very few planets in my mind while other planets that I explained now
are the data of 2018 that I read books and note their data in my notes. The planets that I
know perfectly have * sign before them. While others are from other books but mine words
not books.</p>
<v>Kepler-22b:</v>
<p>Kepler-22b orbits a star known as
Kepler-22, it is G type star that our Sun
type. Keppler-22b is classified into
mini-Neptune or Super Earths. It is
small ice giant like Neptune. It revolve
around host stars in 290 days. It is also
present in Golidlocks zone. Its radius is
2.4 times of Earth radius. At the time of
its discovery, scientists were not able to
confirm these details. It is also called
Green Giant and star light also looks
like green here.</p>
<v>Gliese-581G:</v>
<p>
    <z>Location:</z>
    It orbit around the red
Dwarf star (GJ-581 or Gliza) in 37
Earth days, it is 20.7 light years away
from us (earth) in the constellation
Libra. It was discovered in 2010 and it
was 1st planet that was famous for its
life ability like Earth and a short movie
(zarmina's world) was made in
Australia on it in 2021.Gliese 581g is located within the
habitable zone (also known as the
Goldilocks zone) of its host star (Gliza).
    <z>Atmosphere:</z>
In this planet liquid also exist with
cloudy atmosphere means it also have
rain on have rain on its atmosphere 
    <z>Temperature:</z>
Temperature is nearly equal to Russia
and Green Land (209K to 228 K =
−64 °C to −45 °C = −83 °F to −49 °F).
    <z>Size and period:</z>
Its size is 3 to 4 times of Earth and its
orbital period is 37 earth days.
    <z>Tidily locked:</z>
It is tidily locked planet means its one
face is always towards the star while
have always night. Means that one part
of planet is hot while other is extremely
cold. Due to ( −45 °C) at hot side we
can say that life is possible on Day side
but it can be restless due to day. But we
can live between day and night</p>

<p>
    <z>Introduction:</z>
    Also known as Earth's cousin is an, but I call it Earth 2.0 or Earth’s Twin.
    <z>Discovery:</z>
    Exoplanet that was discovered by NASA's Kepler space telescope in 2015 and claimed as more habitable than Gliesce581G.
    <z>Star:</z>
    Kepler-452b orbits a star called Kepler-452, which is very similar to our Sun.
    <z>Location:</z>
    This star is located about 1,400 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Cygnus. 
    <z>Danger:</z>
    If there are asteroids or comets around this Star then its very difficult to survive here. Means there’s no planet like Jupiter that pulls and make the path of comet as curvy. If a comet hit by this planet then same thing will happens to us that happened with Dinosaurs when they ended. 
    <z>Zone, Size and Temperature:</z>
    Kepler-452b is located in the habitable zone of its host star. This star have size a little bigger than our Sun. And Kepler-452b is (one AU ± Tolerance) away from its star. Have temperature  ( −8 °C to 12 °C).Its size is 1.6 times of size of Earth. Refer as Super Earth.
    <z>Core:</z>
    No one knows about its core, we don’t have any idea about it, if core is rotating means that it have magnetic field and it can save us from Kepler-452’s cosmic rays and Kepler-452’s solar flare. But if there’s no such core means that we have to faced the solar flares and we can die. 
    <z>Period:</z>
    Its orbital period is 385 Earth days that’s nearly equal to Earth year.</p>

    <h2>Rogue Planets</h2>
    <p>The planets that don’t have their own star. They move freely in space and around the galaxy. It is hard to find these planets with visible light, as they can be observed using infrared or other wave spectra. They are extremely cold, colder than the farthest planets from stars. There’s a black hole in between our galaxy, around which all stars revolve. I believe all rogue planets are planets.</p>
    
    <b>Microlensing:</b>
    <p>Microlensing is a technique used to detect rogue planets. It occurs when a planet passes in front of a distant star, bending and magnifying its light due to gravitational lensing, which helps in detecting these isolated planets.</p>

    <v>PSO J318.5-22:</v>
    <p>PSO J318.5-22 is 80 light years away from us and has a mass 6 times greater than Jupiter. It is a young planet, formed nearly 12 million years ago.</p>
    
    <v>CWISEP J1935-1546:</v>
    <p>CWISEP J1935-1546 is 33.6 light years away and 3.7 times the size of Jupiter. It was discovered in 2020 using the microlensing method, providing valuable insights into the existence of isolated planets.</p>

    <h2>Telescope and Time</h2>
    <p>Imagine there are aliens living on other planets, watching Earth with a telescope, and at the same time, we on Earth are also watching them. But remember, we don’t see the present time. We see the past of each other. They see the age of dinosaurs, or even earlier ages when Earth was like a Super Earth (a hot ball), or they might see the ice age. And we also see their past.</p>
    
    <p>The reason why this happens is related to how we observe light. We only see light when it strikes an object and enters our eyes, allowing us to perceive the object's past. The distance between us on Earth is so small that we don’t feel like we’re watching the past of an object. The time difference is on the order of (10<sup>-100</sup> seconds), so we don't perceive it here on Earth. However, on exoplanets, which are thousands and millions of light years away from us, we see each other's past. The light from these planets takes millions of years to reach us.</p>
    
    <p>In short, we are watching the past of everything through our telescopes. This phenomenon is also referred to as Einstein's time cone.</p>

    <h2>Stars</h2>
    
    <b>Definition</v>
    <p>A star is not just a hot ball of burning gases, but rather a ball of gases undergoing nuclear fusion inside it. The Sun, for example, makes up 99% of the mass in our solar system. Stars are held together by their own gravity, and they play a crucial role in shaping galaxies and the universe as a whole.</p>
    
    <v>Birth of Stars</v>

        <p>Stars are born from massive clouds of gas and dust in space, known as molecular clouds.</p>
        <p>Gravitational forces cause these clouds to contract into smaller regions, forming protostars.</p>
    
    <p>You might wonder, if stars are born from gas clouds, then how does gravity arise in the first place? The answer lies in dark matter. Dark matter, which has mass, helps generate gravitational forces. This gravitational force pulls gases together, and through the strong gravity and the collision of atomic nuclei, nuclear fusion begins. This process marks the birth of a star.</p>
</div>
<div class="container1">
    <h2>Planets</h2>
    
    <p>Planets are celestial bodies that have a particular shape and size, often accompanied by moons. They form in the middle age of stars and are born when a star releases excess energy or when a large object impacts the star.</p>
    
    <h2>Death of Stars</h2>
    <z>Low Mass Stars</z>
    <p>Stars like the Sun will eventually exhaust their hydrogen fuel in the core. As hydrogen fusion decreases, the core contracts, and the outer layers expand, forming a red giant. In the end, these stars shed their outer layers, creating a planetary nebula, and the core becomes a white dwarf. This white dwarf will never undergo nuclear fusion again. It is theorized that, after a long time, the white dwarf could eventually become a black dwarf.</p>
    
    <z>High Mass Stars</z>
    <p>Massive stars have shorter lifespans. They undergo a more complex series of fusion reactions, producing heavier elements like carbon, oxygen, and eventually iron. Since iron cannot undergo fusion to release energy, the core collapses, triggering a catastrophic event known as a supernova. The remnants of the core can become a neutron star or, in the most massive cases, a black hole.</p>
</div>
<div class="container1">
    <h2>Types of Stars</h2>
    
    <h3>Main Sequence Stars</h3>
    <p>Main Sequence stars, including the Sun, have hydrogen as their fuel and are in the primal period of their life. They are in the stable phase of fusion, where hydrogen is converted into helium in their cores.</p>
    
    <h3>Red Giants</h3>
    <p>Red Giants are in their last stage. They have burned through all their fuel and increased their mass to gain more fuel. An example of a red giant is UY Scuti.</p>
    
    <h3>White Dwarfs</h3>
    <p>White dwarfs were once like the Sun, but when their fuel runs out, they collapse due to their own gravity. They no longer undergo nuclear fusion and gradually cool over time. The end stage of a white dwarf is theorized to be a black dwarf.</p>
    
    <h3>Blue Giants</h3>
    <p>Blue Giants are massive, extremely hot, and incredibly bright (luminous stars). They are also known as young stars. When their appearance is blue mixed with white, it means they are so young that molecular clouds are visible around them. Stars like Alnitak, Alnilam, Mintaka (from the Orion belt), and Sirius are examples of blue giants. When they die, they can become a supernova, a neutron star, or a black hole.</p>
    
    <h3>Supergiants</h3>
    <p>Supergiants are the largest and most massive stars in the universe. They can be hundreds of times the size of the Sun. UY Scuti is the largest known star in 2024 and is colder than the Sun.</p>
    
    <h3>Neutron Stars</h3>
    <p>Neutron stars are the dense remnants of massive stars that form after a supernova. They are composed entirely of neutrons, and their diameter is only a few kilometers. When they rotate and emit radiation, they are referred to as pulsars.</p>
    
    <h3>Variable Stars</h3>
    <p>Some stars vary in brightness over time. These are called variable stars. An example of a variable star is UY Scuti.</p>
    
    <h3>Protostars</h3>
    <p>Protostars are the process of young stars forming. They have a gas-like disk surrounding them, similar to stellar nurseries found in nebulae.</p>

    <h2>Some Famous Stars</h2>
    
    <h3>Sirius (Alpha Canis Majoris)</h3>
    <p>Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky and is located 8.6 light years away from Earth. Sirius consists of two stars: Sirius A and Sirius B, which revolve around each other in a hierarchical system. (For more information on this system, refer to the Multiple Star System</a> topic.)</p>

     </figure>

    
    <h3>Sirius (Alpha Canis Majoris)</h3>
    <p><strong>Stellar Classification:</strong> Sirius is classified as an A-type main-sequence star.</p>
    <p><strong>Brightness:</strong> It is the brightest star in our night sky, after planets. Its apparent visual magnitude is approximately -1.46, making it more than 20 times brighter than the Sun.</p>

    <h3>Quran About Sirius</h3>
    <p>In the Quran, Sura 53 (Al Najam = Star), Verse 39 mentions:</p>
    <blockquote>
        وَأَنَّهُۥ هُوَ رَبُّ ٱلشِّعْرَىٰ = And He alone is the Lord of Sirius
    </blockquote>
    <p>This verse signifies the importance of Sirius, also known as "Al-Shi'ra" in Arabic.</p>

    <h4>Watch the Miracle of Quran</h4>
    <p>In the first verse of Sura Najam, it mentions:</p>
    <blockquote>
        وَٱلنَّجْمِ إِذَا هَوَىٰ = By the star when it falls.
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>In verse 32nd:</p>
    <blockquote>
        ٱلَّذِينَ يَجْتَنِبُونَ كَبَـٰٓئِرَ ٱلْإِثْمِ وَٱلْفَوَٰحِشَ إِلَّا ٱللَّمَمَ ۚ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ وَٰسِعُ ٱلْمَغْفِرَةِ ۚ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِكُمْ إِذْ أَنشَأَكُم مِّنَ ٱلْأَرْضِ وَإِذْ أَنتُمْ أَجِنَّةٌۭ فِى بُطُونِ أُمَّهَـٰتِكُمْ ۖ فَلَا تُزَكُّوٓا۟ أَنفُسَكُمْ ۖ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَنِ ٱتَّقَىٰٓ 
    </blockquote>
    <p>ٱلْأَرْضِ = Earth.</p>

    <p>In between these two words, there are 32 verses and 861 words. Interestingly, the distance between Earth and Sirius is 8.61 light years. When converted to centi-light years, it becomes:</p>
    <p><strong>8.61 × 100 = 861 centi-light years</strong></p>
    <p>How many light year in 1 centi light year? The answer is 0.01. We assume you are converting between light year and centilight year. You can view more details on each measurement unit: light year or centi light year The SI base unit for length is the metre. 1 metre is equal to 1.0570008340246E-16 light year, or 1.0570008340246E-14 centi light year.

    <h2>Alpha Centauri</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Type:</strong> Triple Star System</p>
    <p><strong>Components:</strong> Alpha Centauri A, Alpha Centauri B, Proxima Centauri</p>
    <p><strong>Distance:</strong> 4.37 light-years from Earth</p>
    
    <h3>System Overview</h3>
    <p>Alpha Centauri is the closest star system to our Sun. It consists of three stars:</p>
    <ul class="alpha-centauri-list">
    <li><strong>Alpha Centauri A</strong> – The largest and brightest of the three stars, located at the center of the system.</li>
    <li><strong>Alpha Centauri B</strong> – A companion star that revolves around Alpha Centauri A in a non-hierarchical system.</li>
    <li><strong>Proxima Centauri</strong> – A red dwarf star that is part of the system, revolving around Alpha Centauri B.</li>
</ul>


    <h3>Habitable Zone</h3>
    <p>Proxima Centauri, the closest star to the Sun in the system, lies within the habitable zone. This means that planets in orbit around it could potentially support life under the right conditions.</p>
    <h2>Kepler-452</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Type:</strong> G-type Star</p>
    <p><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 1810 light-years</p>
    <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 5757K (Close to the Sun's temperature of 5788K)</p>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Cygnus Constellation</p>
    
    <h3>Star Overview</h3>
    <p>Kepler-452 is a G-type star, with a mass and size nearly equal to or 5-10% greater than the Sun. It is located 1810 light-years away from Earth in the Cygnus region of the sky.</p>

    <h3>Planetary System</h3>
    <p>Kepler-452 has one known planet, which we've already discussed above. Whether life can exist here depends on several factors:</p>
    
        <p>Jupiter-like object:</strong> There is no Jupiter-like planet to pull away potentially dangerous comets, which could pose a threat to life.</p>
        <p><strong>Magnetic Field:</strong> We are unsure of the planet's core structure and whether it could protect against cosmic rays or solar flares from the star.</p>
        <p>Outer Protection: If Kepler-452 lacks a structure like the Oort Cloud or a Kuiper Belt, it could impact the possibility of life due to increased exposure to cosmic threats</p>
    
    
    <h2>UY Scuti</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Type:</strong> Red Supergiant</p>
    <p><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 9500 light-years</p>
    <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 3365K (Cooler than the Sun)</p>
    <p><strong>Radius:</strong> 1700 times the radius of the Sun</p>
    
    <h3>Star Overview</h3>
    <p>UY Scuti is an extremely massive red giant star, with a radius 1700 times greater than that of our Sun. It is located about 9500 light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Scutum. Despite being cooler than the Sun with a temperature of 3365K, it is much larger in size.</p>
    
    <h3>Variable Star</h3>
    <p>UY Scuti is a variable star, meaning its brightness changes over time due to specific conditions. This variability makes it an intriguing object for study in stellar physics.</p>
    
    <h3>Current State and Life Cycle</h3>
    <p>Though UY Scuti has reached the stage of a red giant, its life cycle seems to be coming to an end. It is expected to eventually explode as a supernova. As of now, it remains a red giant, but in the future, it may undergo a dramatic transformation into a supernova, signaling the end of its life.</p>
    
    <h3>Planetary System</h3>
    <p>UY Scuti does not have a known planetary system. Its immense size and evolving state may make it unsuitable for hosting planets.</p>

    <h2>Planet Hosting Stars</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Theoretical Concept:</strong> When a small star with no planets dies, it typically turns into a white dwarf. However, in some cases, a rogue planet or a similar massive object could attract the star, causing it to orbit the planet. This is a theoretical concept, and there is no concrete proof yet, but it remains an interesting possibility.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Conditions for the Concept:</strong> For this scenario to be possible, the rogue planet should be significantly larger than the failed star, at least 17 times or more the mass of the small star (like Jupiter). If such a massive planet exists, it could potentially capture a white dwarf and have it orbit around it.</p>

    <h3>SIMP J01365663+093347Ω</h3>
    <p>SIMP J01365663+093347Ω is a rogue planet with its own planetary system, and it might be capable of hosting a star as per the above theoretical scenario. This planet is significantly large and could potentially pull in a small, failed star (white dwarf) into its orbit, but further research and observation are required to confirm this possibility.</p>

<div class="container2">
    <h2>Nebula</h2>

    <p>A nebula is a beautiful object made up of fog, mist, and ionized gases. Much like how humans leave behind remains after death, stars also leave behind their remains when they die. This remains, when dust collapses under the pull of gravity, forms stars. This dust is called a nebula.</p>
    
    <v>Nebulae as Cosmic Clouds</v>
    <p>Nebulae are vast cosmic clouds, spanning thousands of light years. They are composed of dust and gases that can eventually form new stars.</p>

    <v>Formation of Stars</v>
    <p>Stars are born within nebulae. Before stars are formed, they exist in nebula form. When the dust within the nebula collapses due to gravity, stars are created. Essentially, one star's remains contribute to the birth of a new star, completing a cosmic cycle.</p>

    <h2>White Dwarf</h2>

    <p>A white dwarf is the dead remnant of a star, and its size is no larger than that of Earth. It marks the end of a low-mass star's life cycle. When a star undergoes continuous nuclear fusion, the remnants of this process eventually form a white dwarf. These stars are extremely hot, reaching temperatures of up to 100,000°C.</p>

    <v>Formation and Characteristics</h3>
    <p>The gravity of a white dwarf pulls its electrons inward, causing it to collapse. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state. This creates resistance against further compression, allowing the white dwarf to remain stable despite its intense gravitational pull.</p>

    <h3>Long Lifespan and Binary Systems</h3>
    <p>White dwarfs have an incredibly long lifespan, potentially lasting as long as the age of the Universe. They can also exist in binary systems, where they may interact with other stars.</p>

    <h3>UR Frequency Research</h3>
    <p>UR Frequency will explore the mysteries of white dwarfs and related phenomena in future research.</p>

<h2>Black Dwarf</h2>
 <p>
A black dwarf is a theoretical star. When a star remain will cool down and goes in a stage when no light or heat emitted. Such conditions are theoretical but also maybe there’s chance of existence.

<h2>Pulsar</h2>
<p> 
Pulsars are highly magnetized, rapidly rotating neutron stars, they emit radiations in form of radio waves. Their rotation produces spin and these spins are 100 of spin per second. It is also called cosmic light house in universe. Because our elder show us path that they had made and died like roads and rails and maps and light house on Seas. Similarly if you lost in universe the dead stars will help you to find the way.

<h2>Quasars</h2>
 <p>
Quasars are extremely luminous and energetic centers of galaxies and they are powered up by nearby Blackholes and when material enter in black hole it emit energy as cosmic bonfire. </p>

    <h2>Neutron Star</h2>

    <p>A neutron star is one of the densest objects in the universe, second only to black holes. It forms after a supernova explosion and is made entirely of neutrons. The diameter of a neutron star is only a few kilometers, and it rotates, emitting radiation. These rotating neutron stars are called pulsars.</p>

    <v>1. Density</v>
    <p>Neutron stars are incredibly dense, but not as dense as black holes. A neutron star with a radius of just 10 km has a mass equal to that of the Sun. In fact, a teaspoon of neutron star material would weigh as much as the entire Earth.</p>

    <v>2. Composition</v>
    <p>Neutron stars are primarily composed of neutrons. In their cores, protons and other particles are present, but they are so densely packed that positive and negative particles combine to form neutral neutrons.</p>

    <v>3. Strong Magnetic Fields</v>
    <p>Neutron stars possess extremely strong magnetic fields, which are billions of times stronger than Earth's magnetic field.</p>

    <v>4. Rapid Rotation</v>
    <p>Neutron stars spin rapidly, sometimes rotating up to 100 times per second. This rapid rotation is a result of the core's spin after the star's collapse during the supernova event.</p>

    <v>5. Gravitational Time Dilation</v>
    <p>Due to the extreme density of neutron stars, their gravitational pull is incredibly strong. This leads to significant time dilation, meaning time passes much slower near the surface of a neutron star.</p>

    <v>6. High Temperatures</v>
    <p>Initially, neutron stars are very hot, but as they age, they gradually cool down.</p>

    <v>7. Pulsars</v>
    <p>Pulsars are a specific type of neutron star that spins even faster. They emit regular bursts of radiation as they rotate, making them observable as "pulses" of light from Earth.</p>

    <h2>Supernova</h2>

    <p>A supernova is an astronomical event that occurs when a massive star reaches the end of its life and undergoes a violent expulsion of its outer layers. It is one of the most energetic and luminous phenomena in the universe. Supernovae can briefly outshine an entire galaxy, emitting more energy than the Sun will in its entire lifetime.</p>

    <v>1. Cause of a Supernova</v>
    <p>A supernova occurs when a massive star (usually several times the mass of our Sun) has exhausted its nuclear fuel. The core contracts, and the outer layers collapse inward, triggering a powerful explosion that sends the star’s material scattering through space.</p>

    <v>2. Types of Supernovae</v>
    <p>There are two main types of supernovae: Type I and Type II. Type I occurs when a white dwarf in a binary system accumulates enough material from its companion star to initiate fusion and explode. Type II happens when a massive star reaches the end of its life and its core collapses under gravity.</p>

    <v>3. Energy Release</v>
    <p>During a supernova, an immense amount of energy is released in the form of light and heat, making the event visible across vast distances. Supernovae can briefly outshine the entire galaxy in which they reside.</p>

    <v>4. Stellar Remnants</v>
    <p>After a supernova, the remains of the star can form a neutron star or a black hole, depending on the mass of the star. The expelled material enriches the surrounding space with heavier elements, contributing to the formation of new stars, planets, and other cosmic bodies.</p>
    
    <h2>Molecular Cloud</h2>

    <p>A molecular cloud, also known as a stellar nursery, is a cold and dense region in space where stars are born. These clouds are primarily composed of molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) but also contain other molecules such as carbon monoxide (CO), ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), water (H<sub>2</sub>O), and various organic compounds.</p>

    <v>1. Temperature and Density</v>
    <p>The maximum temperature in molecular clouds is between 10K and 20K. They are the coldest regions in space, which helps in the formation of molecular hydrogen. These clouds are incredibly dense and closely packed, which leads to strong gravitational forces.</p>

    <v>2. Gravitational Collapse</v>
    <p>Due to the intense gravity within the molecular clouds, the material inside them begins to collapse under its own weight. As this process continues, the temperature of the material increases and the cloud starts to glow.</p>

    <v>3. Star Formation</v>
    <p>The rising temperature and pressure eventually lead to the onset of nuclear fusion, marking the birth of a new star. These stellar nurseries are the primary locations for star formation in the universe.</p>

    <h2>Moons</h2>

    <p>Moons, also known as natural satellites, are common celestial objects in our solar system and beyond. Moons come in a wide variety of sizes, compositions, and characteristics.</p>

    <b>Moons in Our Solar System</b>

    <v>Earth's Moon:</v>
    <p>Earth's Moon (Luna) is the most well-known natural satellite in our solar system. It is the fifth-largest moon and is large compared to Earth. The diameter of the moon is 3474.8 km.</p>

    <figure class="image-container">

     </figure>
    <p>The satellites that humans send to space are also considered moons. There’s another moon too, which was an asteroid orbiting Earth. Its diameter is 160 km, less than 1 km in size, making it invisible to the naked eye. Discovered in 2016, it has been claimed that Earth has two moons. It was named Kamoʻoalewa.</p>

    <v>Mars' Moons (Phobos and Deimos):</v>
    <p>Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos (NASA names only). They are irregularly shaped and are believed to be captured asteroids.</p>

    <v>Jupiter's Moons:</v>
    <p>Jupiter has a large number of moons, with the four largest being the Galilean moons. These moons have some fascinating features including active volcanoes on Io, an ice-covered ocean on Europa, and a varied landscape on Ganymede.</p>

    <v>Saturn's Moons:</v>
    <p>Saturn has over 80 known moons, including Titan, which is the second-largest moon in the solar system. Titan has frozen sea water, and humans could potentially live on it if the temperature were moderate.</p>

    <v>Uranus' Moons:</v>
    <p>Uranus has 27 known moons, including Titania and Oberon, which are its largest. These moons are believed to be composed of water ice and rock.</p>

    <v>Neptune's Moons:</v>
    <p>Neptune has 14 known moons, including Triton, the largest. Triton is fascinating with geysers, a thin nitrogen atmosphere, and a retrograde orbit, suggesting it was likely captured by Neptune's gravity.</p>

    <h2>Quran About Moons</h2>
    <p><b>Sura 54, verse 1-2:</b>
    The Hour has come near, and the moon has split [in two]. And if they see a miracle, they turn away and say, 'Passing magic'.</p>

    <p><b>Sura 10, Verse 5:</b>
    He (Allah) is the One who has made the sun a glow, and the moon a light, and determined for it stages, so that you may learn the number of the years, and the calculation (of time). Allah has not created all this but for a rightful purpose. He elaborates the signs for a people who understand.</p>

    <p><b>Sura 21, Verse 33:</b>
    It is He (Allah) Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Each of them is floating in its orbit.</p>

    <h2>Black Hole</h2>

    <p>A black hole is a region of space-time from which nothing, not even light, can escape, because gravity is so strong.</p>

    <p>All the energy we get, from a small particle of Earth to the largest Sunlight, its original source is a black hole present in each galaxy.</p>

    <b>Types of Black Holes</b>
    <p>The black holes are categorized into two types based on their mass, energy, size, and formation:</p>
    
        <p>Galactic Black Holes<p>
        <p>Star Death Cause Black Holes</p>
    
    <p>All black holes have different compositions, but they share similar properties.</p>

    <v>Galactic Black Holes</v>
    <p>The great mystery about these black holes is how they form, as they are so large that they can span entire arms of a galaxy, even being larger than some galaxies themselves.</p>

    <v>Star Death and Black Hole Formation</v>
    <p>To understand the formation of black holes, we need to look at the life cycle of a star. It starts as:</p>
    <ol>
        <p>Molecular clouds, which then convert into Proto stars.</p>
        <p>These proto stars form open clusters, which eventually lead to the creation of three types of stars:
            <p>
                <p>First: Massive star (>8M Sun)</p>
                <p>Second: Low mass star (equal to or greater than the Sun, or <8M Sun)</p>
                <p>Third: Lowest mass star (0.08M Sun)</p>
        
    </ol>

    <li>The life cycle of a massive star goes as follows:</p>
    
        <p>Converts into a red supergiant.</p>
        <p>Then transforms into a supernova (Type 2).</p>
        <li>The result can be:
        
                <p>A supernova remnant</p>
                <p>A black hole</li>
                <p>A neutron star</li>
         

    <v>Silent Black Holes</v>
    <p>I have a research paper on silent black holes. While some may believe they are not accurate, I believe that black holes can be living objects. Some black holes are active, as explained earlier, but others are silent. They do not attract anything, and this remains a mystery.</p>

    <h2>Dark Energy and Dark Matter</h2>
    <p>The universe and all multiverses are mostly made by these two terms. But remember when there’s no gravity means there’s no mass, means here dark matter doesn’t exist, also there are no objects there, there’s no force to keep them away and make it expansion, means that dark energy doesn’t exist here.</p>

    <h2>Temperature and Energy</h2>
    <p>There’s no temperature here. The temperature of space is 2.7 Kelvin because of energy in the universe. But here, no object, no mass, no energy means there’s no temperature.</p>

    <h2>Natural Forces, Life, and Death</h2>
    <p>In dark infinity, no natural forces exist. Here you’re dead and alive both at a time. Here you can learn the concept of a new cat, not Schrödinger's cat. This topic is too interesting!</p>
    <p>In our universe or any other universe, mass exists, made by atoms, which are made of nuclei and electrons. The nucleus is held together by the strong force. In dark infinity, with no strong force, no nucleus, no atom, no matter, and no body can exist.</p>

    <h2>Time</h2>
    <p>This topic is crazy and beautiful. We are living in the simulation of time. That’s the reason we can’t see our GOD (Allah Almighty).</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Surah Al-Qiyama: "Some faces, that Day, will be radiant, Looking at their Lord."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Day of Judgement is the end of time, with no limits. The limit on us to see God is time.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <b>Surah 55, Verse 33:</b><p> "O assembly of the jinn and the men! If you are able to pass through the regions of the heavens and the earth, then pass through; you cannot pass through but with authority."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This was a glimpse into the dark infinity — where concepts of space, time, and existence collapse into nothingness. Fascinating, isn’t it?</p>

<div class="container1">
    <h2>Mathematical Multiverse</h2>
    <p>Most wide Multiverse and endless thing that can ever exist. Maths itself a universe. Because math is reality and we can’t deny it. Everything that obeys or not obey laws of physics like universe obey laws of physics but black holes singularity don’t obey laws of physics. But it obeys laws of Mathematics.</p>
    <p>If a thing that don’t comes under maths its mean its not reality. The real reality is Maths. After end level of Multiverse the infinite dark comes where physics, chemistry and biology died. But two things always here. 1st Holy Quran and 2nd Mathematics. The things after infinite dark also obey maths. But it’s a level where it can obey. It fails when the angles level starts. But we not deal with them. We deal in our limit of simulation that we were made.</p>
    <p>Maths Multiverse doesn’t mean that we live in Multiverse with shape of (+,-,×,÷). No, its mean we live under laws of maths. Everything around us obey maths. We can’t hide reality and reality is maths. Maths also told us that Nothing in this universe is in spherical form. Everything is just linear boxes and lines and when they’re too much little that we can’t see them and they turn again and again and billions of small linear lines makes a curve we call it circle.</p>
    <p>Fibonacci Sequence and Phi and CNC arm working explain this very well.</p>
    <h2>Fibonacci Sequence and Phi</h1>
    <p>Also called Golden ratio. Everything in the universe follows this number. This is the modern age number. Leonardo in Italy Pisa in the year 1202 (it might be devil work as people say that he worshipped the devil and opened Codex Gigas, but I think it's his research and he made a great sequence, I appreciate it) made this sequence. These are the numbers showing that everything is linear, but a combination of linearity makes a spiral. The numbers in this sequence build the universe. Now, let's see:</p>
    <p>Each number is the sum of the previous one:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>0</li>
        <li>1</li>
        <li>1 + 0 = 1</li>
        <li>1 + 1 = 2</li>
        <li>2 + 1 = 3</li>
        <li>3 + 2 = 5</li>
        <li>5 + 3 = 8</li>
        <li>8 + 5 = 13</li>
        <li>13 + 8 = 21</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now we got a sequence:</p>
    <p>0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, ……….</p>

<h2>Nikola Tesla Numbers</h1>
    <p>According to Tesla, 3, 6, and 9 are the only numbers that can exist as Energy without losing their identity. For energy, a modern Physics person can tell you, but mathematically, it works on Resonance (this includes multiples of frequencies, and these frequencies use these numbers), Symmetry and patterns (these numbers have fewer mathematical fundamental answers, so they make symmetry), Vortex maths (these numbers have unique patterns in the decimal system that can explain the truths of the universe, but a quantum person can tell you how). These numbers also explain the Fibonacci Sequence because they are mostly related to 3, 6, and 9.</p>

    <v>Now let's discuss them.</v>
    <p>First, let's look at 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8. You can perform this operation on any number in the list, and you won’t get 3, 6, and 9.</p>

    <p>Now let's look at:</p>
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>1</th>
            <th>1+1 = 2</th>
            <th>2+2 = 4</th>
            <th>4+4 = 8</th>
            <th>8+8 = 16</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="5">See we don't get 3, 6, and 9. See (1+6 = 7), (7+7 = 14), and (1+4 = 5) and (5+5 = 10 and (1+0 = 1) that makes my answer).</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <v>Now come at 3, 6, and 9:</v>

    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>Sum (3)</th>
            <th>Tesla Number</th>
            <th>Sum (6)</th>
            <th>Tesla Number</th>
            <th>Sum (9)</th>
            <th>Tesla Number</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3+3 = 6</td>
            <td>6</td>
            <td>6+6 = 12</td>
            <td>1+2 = 3</td>
            <td>9+9 = 18</td>
            <td>1+8 = 9</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>6+6 = 12</td>
            <td>1+2 = 3</td>
            <td>12+12 = 24</td>
            <td>2+4 = 6</td>
            <td>18+18 = 36</td>
            <td>3+6 = 9</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>12+12 = 24</td>
            <td>2+4 = 6</td>
            <td>24+24 = 48</td>
            <td>4+8 = 12 = 1+2 = 3</td>
            <td>36+36 = 72</td>
            <td>7+2 = 9</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>24+24 = 48</td>
            <td>4+8 = 12 = 1+2 = 3</td>
            <td>48+48 = 96</td>
            <td>9+6 = 15 = 1+5 = 6</td>
            <td>72+72 = 144</td>
            <td>1+4+4 = 9</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Now see, 3 and 6 have something in common. Both have a sequence and depend on each other. But 9 is independent. Every number depends on these three numbers.</p>

    <v>Now see such things in the Holy Quran:</v>
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>Quantity</th>
            <th>Sum</th>
            <th>Tesla Number</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Letters in Quran327792</td>
            <td>3+2+7+7+9+2 = 30 = 3+0</td>
            <td>3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Raque</td>
            <td>540 = 5+4+0</td>
            <td>9</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Verses</td>
            <td>6,348 = 6+3+4+8 = 21 = 2+1</td>
            <td>3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Surah</td>
            <td>114 = 1+1+4</td>
            <td>6</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>30 Chapters</td>
            <td>3+0</td>
            <td>3</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>See, we don't get 3, 6, and 9. Again, see (1+6 = 7), (7+7 = 14), and (1+4 = 5) and (5+5 = 10 and (1+0 = 1) that makes my answer).</p>
